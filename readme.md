# how to work on xiome as a developer

<br/>

## üí° getting started

&nbsp; **prerequisites**
- install `git`, `nodejs`, `vscode`, and [connect github with ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- if you're on windows, setup [wsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)

&nbsp; **initial setup**
- fork the xiome project on github, and git clone your fork
- open a terminal in your cloned directory, and run these commands
  - `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
  - `npm run build` to build the project

&nbsp; **during your development session**
- run these background processes, each in their own terminal
  - `npm run watch` to continually rebuild source files on save
  - `npm start` to run a local http server at http://localhost:5000/  
    *(if npm start fails, try it again, it often works the second time)*
  - *note:* [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) is a great way to split terminal windows
  - *note:* of course, when you're done, end each process by pressing `ctrl+c`
- open vscode by running `code .`
  - you should be able to see the xiome platform website at http://localhost:5000/x/
  - and the app development mocksite at http://localhost:5000/x/mocksite/
  - now you are ready to code
  - when you save a typescript or pug file, the watch routine will automatically rebuild it, so you can press refresh in the browser to see the changes
  - you can press vscode hotkey `ctrl+shift+b` to run the typescript build, which allows vscode to nicely highlight typescript errors for you to address

&nbsp; **things to understand**
- mock mode
  - the watch routine builds xiome into a "mock" mode
  - in mock mode, you don't need to run the xiome server, or connect to any databases
  - all of xiome, including the backend business logic, is running in the browser (and is easily debuggable there)

<br/>

## ü¶Ö xiome's codebase from a bird's eye view

everything about xiome is fully contained in this single git repository.  
let's take a stroll through the codebase.
- `.github/`  
  this is where the github actions live.  
  they do continuous integration and deployments.  
- `.vscode/`  
  this is where the settings for the vscode editor live.  
  it makes sure you'll indent with tabs as jesus intended.  
- `helm/`  
  this is where the scary kubernetes code lives.  
  it orchestrates the node servers in the cloud.  
- `s/`  
  this is where all the typescript source code lives.  
  there is where most development happens.  
  - `s/assembly/`  
    this is where all the pieces of xiome are assembled, much like legos, into a working backend and frontend.  
    this place is frightening.  
  - `s/features/`  
    this is where the feature development happens.  
    each feature contains all its backend and frontend code.  
    you should feel cozy here.  
  - `s/framework/`  
    this is where xiome defines its own lingo.  
    important base classes, like component, which is based on lit-element.  
  - `s/toolbox/`  
    this is a big collection of assorted utilities.  
    these might be useful outside of xiome for something totally unrelated.  
    these tools are candidates to become independent libraries one day.  
  - `s/types/`  
    these are where some common system-wide types go.  
    honestly these should be moved into the toolbox.  
- `scripts/`  
  just some handy shell scripts.  
  i use `randomid` a lot to generate new ids.  
- `web/`  
  this is where the https://xiome.io/ website lives.  
  and also the mocksite during development.  
- `x/`  
  these are build artifacts.  
  don't write code here. it gets deleted during each build.  

<br/>

## ü¶µ the anatomy of a feature

xiome's cool code is organized into conceptual features.  
this is probably what you want to work on.  
here's what's in a feature directory:

### frontend
- `feature/components/`  
  web components live here.  
  html/css/js that the user interacts with.  
  components are wired up to models.  
  models give the components the state they should render.  
  models also provide functions that components can use to do smart things.  
- `feature/models/`  
  models are the brains behind components.  
  models coordinate state for components to render.  
  models act as a liaison between components and the backend.  
  often, models are locally caching information loaded from the backend.  
  there's only one instance of each model on the page.  
  models coordinate for components on a page-wide level.  
  generally, we want components to be dumb, leaving the smart logic to the models.  

### backend
- `feature/api/`  
  here's where you'll find the api services.  
  a service is a segment of the api, that has its own auth policy.  
  an auth policy a bouncer, that only lets certain users use the service.  
  here in the api directory, you'll also find definitions for the database tables.  

### testing
- `feature/testing/`  
  this is where testing setup, utilities, and mocks belong.

## ‚öîÔ∏è how to survive within the xiome onion

if you think about xiome like an onion, you'll notice some distinct layers.  
each layer has its own little landscape of concepts and tools you'll need to learn to get anything done.  

### components ‚Äî *what users interact with*
- learn about modern web development
  - learn about web components
  - learn about the shadow dom
  - learn about css custom properties, and css parts
  - learn https://lit.dev/
- learn about `ops`
  - the components commonly use a system called `ops` for loading spinners
  - anything that needs a loading spinner (many things) uses `ops`
  - they're everywhere
  - read how `ops` work further down the readme
- learn about xio vs xiome components
  - component with names starting with `xiome` are "wired up" with models and state management
  - components with names starting with `xio` are simpler standalone components without any wirings
- learn about xiome component wirings
  - xiome components have a property called `this.share`, which is a bag of goodies, like models and other facilities
  - xiome components are wired up with state management, so components will re-render whenever the relevant model state is changed
  - wirings happen in files with names like `integrate-blah-components.ts`
- learn that the `theme.css.ts` exists
  - all components inherit common css in `s/framework/theme.css.ts`

### models ‚Äî *the brains on the frontend*
- learn about services
  - models are provided service objects, which contain async api functions
  - you just call the functions. those are api calls
- learn about `snapstate`
  - snapstate is the state management library for xiome
  - a model must return the relevant snapstate `subscribe` or `track` function
  - learn more about `snapstate` further below
- learn about `ops`
  - they're for loading spinners
  - they're everywhere because lots of things load
  - read more aboutn `ops` further below

### api services ‚Äî *do servery things and talk with the database*
- learn `renraku` and how xiome uses it
  - xiome's api is built with https://github.com/chase-moskal/renraku
  - every async function in `expose` takes a first argument called `auth`
  - `auth` is where you'll find info about the current user
  - `auth` is where you'll find the database tables you need to use
  - `auth` is returned by the `policy` that each service has
- learn `dbby` to interact with the database
  - never forget that every id must be a `DamnId` instance in the database
  - dbby is what powers the magical serverless mock mode for development
  - learn more about `dbby` further down
- learn `darkvalley` for validation
  - it's just some functions for validating user inputs
  - learn more about `darkvalley` further down

<br/>
